I currently work at [Ordbogen A/S](https://ordbogen.com) as a Customer Succes Coordinator, where we provide dictionaries and various e-learning platforms to students and businesses all across Denmark.

In my spare time, I help other developers with their problems, primarily using PHP. I also dabble around with Rust, Golang, C# and lately been interested in some game development with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

Other than programming, I play **a lot** of video games on both PC and PS5. I am what you'd call an [achievement hunter](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=achievement+hunter), so this is where you can find me, if I am not being productive.

If you're interested in hiring me, I am unfortunately not available for any mid-high scale project. I do not do code reviews either. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via e-mail or socials.
